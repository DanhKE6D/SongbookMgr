    - Fix the dialog box that notifies invalid file format
    - Correctly add the song to the favorite book if the song is the same but sung by
      different singers
2013/09/30: v1.0.17
    - Changed icons for media from grayed out to black
    - Sorting long list may cause ANR
    - Limit the singer names to max of 30 chars (otherwise it would mess up the
                                                display)
2013/10/03: v1.0.20
    - Sorting now performed from asyncTask to prevent ANR
    - Put the sound, ff, rwnd icons on the action bar to help with faster access
    - New search function:
        |a    Search for songs begin with 'A' or 'a' inclusively
        |a-b  Search for songs that begin with 'A' or 'a' to 'B' or 'b' inclusively.
        |a-   Search for songs that begin with 'A' or 'a' to the end of the list
        |-a   Search for songs from the beginning of the list to 'A' or 'a' inclusively.
    - Press the SongbookMgr icon in the main songbook display will display the full
      songbook in ascending sort order.
    - Enable searching with diacritics removed from main songlist (Vietnamese language)
      to enable search to match all Vietnamese token from English search text.
 2013/10/04: v1.0.21
    - Rearrange the most used icons to the main activity (home, sound, fast forward, rewind)
    - Remove these icons from quick action menus
    - Remove left over delimiters during file import
    - Install default songlist db that has Vietnamese language
 2013/10/05: v1.0.22 -- release to market
    - Eliminate repeat ' ' chars in search string

 2013/10/25: v1.0.23
    - Improve tcp error handling. Now will timeout in 40s max (vs 1 min), notify the user
      of the communication error, then empty the command queue.
    - Improve custom song entry list. The user now can set the text size of the song
      independent of the singer name
    - Pressing the home button now will also go back to home page.
 2013/11/12: v1.1.21
    - Fixing a bug that would crash if v1.1.xx is installed on top of v1.0.xx. The bug
      is related to SharedPreferences int/boolean key remoteEnable.
 2013/11/22: v1.1.22
    - Improve DB performance during file import. Previously, a 8000 songbook catalog
      would take 150 seconds to load. It only takes < 10 seconds now.
    - Add a menu option on the main songbook to show how many songs are in the collection

      display all 4 permanent icons in the actionbar menu.
 2013/12/19: v1.2.00
    - Remove VNC server support in favor of sbConnectionMgr server. With sbConnectionMgr
      server (same server that runs with VLC), TKaraoke songbook now can be imported
      directly into SongbookMgr. Songbook catalog still has to be generated from TKaraoke
      software, then the filename is registered with sbConnectionMgr (one time setup)
    - Add the ability to check for server connection during network setup
 2014/01/31: v1.2.08
      - Add expandable songbook heading based on song name
      - Add a note in a help file to show the user how to fix screen flickering when using with
        vnc
      - VNC server can now be used together with sbConnectionMgr as song ID key generator. If VNC
        server is used, sbConnectionMgr server is then used primarily to export songbook catalog
        to the mobile device.
  2014/05/25: v1.2.09
      - Fix initial display of VNC port number
      - Change forward/backward icon position so that low res screen has the forward button
        available
      - Add filterable to songlist search
  2014/10/25: v1.2.10
